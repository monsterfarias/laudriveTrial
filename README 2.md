# Basic Starter

This is my start point for a regular project with Browserify for JS module structure.

It is based in Google Starter Kit, but was modified to suit my personal taste for directory structure, CSS framework, JS module loader, and other details.

It includes Compass and SASS for CSS, Browserify and Uglify for JS, all in Gulp tasks.
